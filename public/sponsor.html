	nwHacks (norwthwestHacks) is an annual hackathon held at the University of British Columbia, and is planned 
	to be the premiere community event for young hackers and engineers in the Pacific Northwest Region (including the US and 
	Canada). The event will host some of the best up-and-coming engineers and developers from across the continent and beyond to 
	create mobile, web, and hardware hacks for 48 hours. Bringing in students from around the region, nwHacks is 
	commited to encouraging and kickstarting a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship and community among 
	future hackers of the region. nwHacks seeks to keep innovation in the area through the hackathon and providing a 
	welcoming and supportive environment to allow everyone to realize their dreams and develop their skills. 
	</p>
	<p>
	nwHacks 2015 is scheduled to take place in early January 2015. We are expecting 400 students to attend our event from multiple universities across North America for awesome prizes like Oculus Rifts and Leap Motion controllers, in addition to a $5000 grand prize. With untapped talent from Seattle, Vancouver, and beyond, nwHacks has huge potential for companies looking to recruit the top talent from the top schools. Compared to traditional recruitment strategies, sponsoring a hackathon represents a high-value and low-cost way to secure talent for your company. Many companies have found some of their best employees through hackathons.

	Hackathons also provide sponsors the opportunity to get real feedback on their products by developers who use them. Sponsors can demo their API in front of hackers, generating publicity for themselves and growing developer awareness of their products and services.
